## Devlog
To my knowledge, I think racing games are the best way to describe Scenes, GameObjects, and Coponents. 
The Scene is the place that holds the game world. Lets say a particular map of yours, like rainbow road. 
Then the GameObjects are the things that decorate or make that environment. 
The lights, road, barriers. Although without components those objects don't have any actual meaning. Components give them meaning. 
You can give the road invisible walls, or touching a mystery cube gives you and item. 
Basically, the scene holds everything, the gameobject are the things you want to add, and the components are the characteristics you want to give the GameObjects.
